# Target: Basic Pentest (TryHackMe)

## Objective
Identify vulnerabilities and obtain user-level and root-level access on the target system.

## Scope
Single Linux host in controlled lab environment.

## Methodology
- Reconnaissance
- Enumeration
- Exploitation
- Privilege escalation

## Tools Used
- Nmap
- Gobuster
- Metasploit
- LinPEAS

## Reconnaissance
Performed port scan and identified SSH and HTTP services.

## Enumeration
Enumerated web directories and identified exposed credentials.

## Exploitation
Authenticated via SSH using discovered credentials.

## Privilege Escalation
Identified misconfigured SUID binary and escalated privileges.

## Findings
- Weak credentials  
- Misconfigured permissions  

## Remediation
- Enforce strong password policies
