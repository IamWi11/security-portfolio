# Target: Introduction to SIEM (TryHackMe)

## Objective
Understand the fundamentals of Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems and how SOC analysts use them to detect, investigate, and respond to security incidents.

## Scope
Analysis of security logs and events within a simulated SOC environment provided by TryHackMe. No production systems were accessed.

## Tools Used
- SIEM platform (TryHackMe lab environment)
- Log analysis dashboards
- Event correlation rules

## Methodology
- Reviewed SIEM architecture and data sources
- Analyzed logs from multiple systems
- Identified suspicious events and alerts
- Investigated events using correlation and context

## Findings
- SIEM centralizes log data for visibility
- Correlation rules help detect suspicious behavior
- Alerts require analyst validation to reduce false positives

## Remediation
- Ensure proper log collection and retention
- Tune detection rules to reduce noise
- Establish clear incident response workflows

## Lessons Learned
This lab reinforced how SIEM tools support SOC operations through log analysis, alert triage, and structured investigations.
