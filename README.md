# Security Portfolio – William Munoz

This repository contains hands-on cybersecurity work focused on offensive and defensive security concepts, including CTF-style challenges and simulated penetration tests.

All work is performed in authorized lab environments such as TryHackMe and Hack The Box.

### CTF & Lab Writeups
- [Basic Pentest (TryHackMe)](ctf-writeups/tryhackme_basic_pentest.md)
- [Web Enumeration Lab (TryHackMe)](ctf-writeups/tryhackme_web_enum.md)
- [Introduction to SIEM (TryHackMe)](ctf-writeups/tryhackme_intro_to_siem.md)
  
## Hands-on Labs
- TryHackMe: Linux Fundamentals Part 1 — Completed 2026-02-07  
  Skills: filesystem navigation (ls, cd, find, grep), permissions (chmod, chown, umask), processes/services (ps, top, systemctl), packages (apt, dpkg), archives (tar, gzip), SSH/scp, basic networking (ip, ss).

## Goals
This portfolio demonstrates:
- Technical problem-solving
- Security methodology
- Clear documentation and reporting
- Continuous learning

Disclaimer: All targets are intentionally vulnerable lab systems.
